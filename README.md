# C-_Practice


## Practice_1
Practice 1 is an implementation of a 3D version of Tic-Tac-Toe game. It has 3 boards of 3x3 cells each. To win a player must have a series of 3 consecutive cells marked with the same symbol either within the same board or across the 3 boards.

## Practice_2
Practice 2 is an implementation of a very simplified version of the famous BlackJack card game. We will drop all the complicated rules and we will consider that the game is played by one player against the computer.
